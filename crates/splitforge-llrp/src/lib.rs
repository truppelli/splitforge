//! # splitforge-llrp
//!
//! LLRP reader adapter: binary protocol parsing, connection lifecycle, and reconnect.
//!
//! **Status:** empty. This is the Milestone 0 planning scaffold — see
//! `docs/roadmap.md` for what lands here and when.
//!
//! ## Boundaries
//!
//! - **May depend on:** splitforge-reader, splitforge-domain
//! - **Must never depend on:** splitforge-engine, splitforge-storage, splitforge-api
//!
//! These rules come from ADR-0001 and are tabulated in `docs/architecture.md`.
//! They are enforced by `crates/splitforge-testkit/tests/dependency_rules.rs`, not left to
//! review (ADR-0012).

// No panicking on any path reachable during an event: a corrupt frame, a missing
// field, or an out-of-range value must become an error the caller can act on, never a
// timer that stops mid-race. Test code is exempt, where panicking on the unexpected is
// the point. See CONTRIBUTING.md, "Code standards".
